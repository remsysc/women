              The beginning of the celebration of Women’s Month can trace its
              roots in the socialist and labor movements in the United States of
              America. The first ever Women’s Day happened in New York City on
              28 February, 1909 as a national observance organized by the
              Socialist Party. This was done to commemorate the one-year
              anniversary of the strikes by garment workers in New York, where a
              large number of women marched through lower Manhattan to Union
              Square to fight for economic rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              International Women’s Day (IWD) was first celebrated on 19 March
              1911. A million women and men rallied in support of women's
              rights. On 25 March 1911, the tragic fire at the Triangle
              Shirtwaist Factory in New York took the lives of more than 140
              working women, exposing the dire labor conditions faced by women.
              This sparked numerous demonstrations organized by the National
              Women’s Trade Union League.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Europe, the Socialist Women’s International Conference
              suggested that 8 March should be IWD to recognize all working
              women globally. By 1975, the United Nations officially designated
              8 March as a global celebration of women’s contributions, courage,
              and achievements.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Philippines, former President Corazon C. Aquino signed
              Proclamation No. 224 in 1988, declaring the first week of March as
              Women’s Week and 8 March as Women’s Rights and International Peace
              Day. Later that year, she designated March as Women’s Role in
              History Month. These initiatives continue to honor women’s
              contributions and raise awareness for gender equality and women’s
              rights.
